    <h1>Cacio e Pepe</h1>
    <img src="../images/cacio_e_pepe.webp">
    <h3>This peasant food comes from Roman sheep herders who had little time and money to spend on eating. They used their sheep's cheese and a bit of the water that cooked the pasta to create a cream, then added black pepper to give it some extra flavor. Cheap, easy, and fast: this was perfect for them and for us even today!</h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pound bucatini (dry)</li>
        <li>2 cups finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Cook bucatini in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place grated Pecorino Romano cheese into a large glass bowl and mix with a fork to make sure the cheese contains no lumps.</li>
        <li>Once the bucatini are al dente, lift them out with a spaghetti fork or tongs and put them directly into the bowl with the cheese. Do not allow the water to drain too much.</li>
        <li>Add one ladle of pasta water to the bowl. Stir the bucatini around until a cream has formed.</li>
        <li>Add more pasta water, little by little, until a thick cream has formed.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle freshly ground pepper over the pasta. Toss and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
